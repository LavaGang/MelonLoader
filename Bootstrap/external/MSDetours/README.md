# Microsoft Research Detours Package

Detours is a software package for monitoring and instrumenting API calls on Windows. Detours
has been used by many ISVs and  is also  used by product teams at Microsoft. Detours is now available under
a standard open source  license (MIT).  This simplifies licensing for programmers using Detours
and allows the community to support Detours using open source tools and processes.

Detours is compatible with the Windows NT family of 
operating systems: Windows NT, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows 7,
Windows 8, and Windows 10.  It cannot be used by Window Store apps
because Detours requires APIs not available to those applications. 
This repo contains the source code for version 4.0.1 of Detours.

For technical documentation on Detours, see the [Detours Wiki](https://github.com/microsoft/Detours/wiki).
For directions on how to build and run samples, see the
samples [README.txt](https://github.com/Microsoft/Detours/blob/master/samples/README.TXT) file.
